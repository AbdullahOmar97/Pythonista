# Pythonista

Pythonista is a project showcasing various Python programming concepts, including decorators, iterators, generators, and dunder (magic) methods.

## Features

- Decorators for calculating function runtime and formatting text.
- Implementation of a LinkedList class with iterator and generator methods.
- Usage of comprehension lists.
- Use of Dunder (Magic) Methods for custom behavior.

## Usage

### Decorators

- `decorators.py` contains decorators for formatting text and calculating function runtime.
- Use these decorators to add desired behavior to your functions.

### LinkedList Class

- `linkedlist.py` implements a LinkedList class with iterator and generator methods.
- Use this class to create and manipulate linked lists.

### Testing

- Unit tests for the LinkedList class and decorators are provided in `tests.py`.
- Run the tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented features.
